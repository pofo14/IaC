What are the advantages of using built-in methods for saving conversations over manual methods?
I apologize, but as an AI assistant, I don't have the capability to directly save or export the conversation for you. However, I can suggest a few methods you can use to save the contents of this chat: [1]

Copy and Paste: The simplest method is to manually select all the text in the chat window, copy it, and paste it into a text document on your computer.

Screenshot: You can take screenshots of the conversation and save them as image files.

Browser Extensions: Some web browsers have extensions that allow you to save entire web pages or conversations.

Print to PDF: Many browsers allow you to "print" the current page to a PDF file, which would save the entire conversation.

Check your platform: Depending on the platform you're using to interact with me, there might be built-in options to save or export conversations. [2]

Remember, when saving any conversation, be mindful of any sensitive information that might be included, such as personal details or code snippets.

If you're using this chat as part of a specific service or platform, you might want to check if that service offers any built-in methods for saving conversations. If you need more specific guidance, please let me know what system or platform you're using to access this chat.

is there a way I can save the results of this chat?

Certainly! I'll simplify the approach and focus on adding just the node_exporter instance for the specific NAS host you're configuring. Here's a more streamlined version:

---
# Your existing plays for mounting disks and installing node_exporter

- name: Configure Prometheus to monitor node_exporter
  hosts: prometheus_server  # Replace with your Prometheus server's hostname or group
  become: yes
  vars:
    prometheus_targets:
      node:
        - targets:
            - "{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ansible_default_ipv4']['address'] }}:9100"
    prometheus_scrape_configs:
      - job_name: "node_exporter_{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        static_configs:
          - targets: "{{ prometheus_targets.node[0].targets }}"

  tasks:
    - name: Include prometheus role
      include_role:
        name: prometheus.prometheus.prometheus
      vars:
        prometheus_config_file: "{{ prometheus_config_dir }}/prometheus.yml"

    - name: Ensure Prometheus is restarted
      systemd:
        name: prometheus
        state: restarted

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
This simplified version does the following:

It targets your Prometheus server.

It defines prometheus_targets with a 'node' job that includes only the current host's IP address and the default node_exporter port (9100). [1]

It sets up a scrape config for this specific node_exporter instance.

It uses the include_role task to apply the prometheus role from the prometheus.prometheus collection. This will update the Prometheus configuration based on the variables we've set. [2]

Finally, it ensures Prometheus is restarted to pick up the new configuration.

To use this:

Add this play to your existing playbook after the node_exporter installation play.

Make sure your inventory correctly identifies your Prometheus server (either by hostname or by being part of a 'prometheus_server' group).

Run your playbook:

ansible-playbook -i your_inventory mount-disks.yml

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
This approach will add only the current NAS host to the Prometheus configuration. Each time you run this playbook on a different host, it will add that host to the Prometheus configuration.

Remember to ensure that:

The prometheus.prometheus collection is installed.

Your Prometheus server is correctly identified in your inventory.

The Prometheus server can reach the node_exporter on the specified IP and port.

If you need to make any adjustments or have any questions about this setup, please let me know!

ok, thanks, can you simplify this one, and use this same approach but just add the node_exporter instance for the nas host I am running the playbook for

Absolutely! You can indeed use the prometheus.prometheus collection to manage your Prometheus configuration. The collection includes a role for managing Prometheus itself, which can be used to update the configuration.

Here's how you can modify your playbook to use the prometheus.prometheus collection:

First, ensure you have the collection installed:

ansible-galaxy collection install prometheus.prometheus

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
Then, update your playbook to include a new play that uses the prometheus role. Here's an example:

---
# Your existing plays for mounting disks and installing node_exporter

- name: Configure Prometheus
  hosts: prometheus_server  # Replace with your Prometheus server's hostname or group
  become: yes
  vars:
    prometheus_targets:
      node:
        - targets:
          "{{ groups['all'] | map('extract', hostvars, ['ansible_default_ipv4', 'address']) | map('regex_replace', '^(.*)$', '\\1:9100') | list }}"
    prometheus_scrape_configs:
      - job_name: "node"
        file_sd_configs:
          - files:
              - "{{ prometheus_config_dir }}/file_sd/node.yml"

  roles:
    - prometheus.prometheus.prometheus

  post_tasks:
    - name: Ensure Prometheus is started and enabled
      systemd:
        name: prometheus
        state: restarted
        enabled: yes

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
This play does the following:

It targets your Prometheus server.

It defines prometheus_targets with a 'node' job that includes all hosts where node_exporter is installed (assuming it's on all hosts in your inventory).

It sets up a scrape config for the 'node' job using file-based service discovery.

It applies the prometheus role from the prometheus.prometheus collection, which will update the Prometheus configuration based on the variables we've set.

Finally, it ensures Prometheus is restarted to pick up the new configuration.

To use this:

Add this play to your existing playbook after the node_exporter installation play.

Make sure your inventory correctly identifies your Prometheus server (either by hostname or by being part of a 'prometheus_server' group).

Run your playbook:

ansible-playbook -i your_inventory mount-disks.yml

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
This method uses the official Prometheus role, which provides a more standardized and maintainable way to manage your Prometheus configuration. It will automatically generate the necessary configuration files based on the variables you provide.

Remember to review the prometheus.prometheus.prometheus role documentation for additional variables and configuration options you might want to set, such as retention time, storage path, etc.

Also, note that this configuration assumes node_exporter is installed on all hosts and listening on port 9100. If this isn't the case, you'll need to adjust the prometheus_targets variable accordingly. [1]

thanks, is there any way to do this using the prometheus.prometheus collection, or another role someone has developed

Certainly! To "register" the node_exporter with your Prometheus server using Ansible, you'll need to update the Prometheus server's configuration to include the new target. Here's how you can do this: [1]

First, add a new play to your playbook that targets your Prometheus server.

In this play, we'll update the Prometheus configuration file to include the new node_exporter target.

After updating the configuration, we'll reload the Prometheus service to apply the changes.

Here's an example of how you can extend your playbook:

---
# Your existing plays for mounting disks and installing node_exporter

- name: Update Prometheus configuration
  hosts: prometheus_server  # Replace with your Prometheus server's hostname or group
  become: yes
  vars:
    prometheus_config_path: "/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml"  # Adjust this path as needed
    node_exporter_port: 9100

  tasks:
    - name: Get IP address of node_exporter host
      set_fact:
        node_exporter_ip: "{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ansible_default_ipv4']['address'] }}"
      delegate_to: "{{ item }}"
      delegate_facts: true
      loop: "{{ groups['all'] }}"  # Assumes node_exporter is installed on all hosts
      run_once: true

    - name: Add node_exporter target to Prometheus configuration
      blockinfile:
        path: "{{ prometheus_config_path }}"
        block: |
          - job_name: 'node_exporter_{{ inventory_hostname }}'
            static_configs:
              - targets: ['{{ node_exporter_ip }}:{{ node_exporter_port }}']
        insertafter: "scrape_configs:"
        marker: "# {mark} ANSIBLE MANAGED BLOCK FOR {{ inventory_hostname }}"
      notify: Reload Prometheus

  handlers:
    - name: Reload Prometheus
      systemd:
        name: prometheus
        state: reloaded

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
This play does the following:

It targets your Prometheus server (you'll need to adjust the hosts line to match your inventory).

It gets the IP address of each host where node_exporter is installed.

It uses the blockinfile module to add a new job configuration for each node_exporter to the Prometheus configuration file.

It uses a handler to reload the Prometheus service after the configuration is updated.

To use this:

Add this play to your existing playbook after the node_exporter installation play.

Adjust the prometheus_config_path variable if your Prometheus configuration file is located elsewhere.

Make sure your inventory correctly identifies your Prometheus server (either by hostname or by being part of a 'prometheus_server' group).

Run your playbook as before:

ansible-playbook -i your_inventory mount-disks.yml

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
This will install node_exporter on your hosts, and then update your Prometheus server to start scraping metrics from these new targets.

Remember to test this in a non-production environment first, as it will modify your Prometheus configuration.

Also, note that this method adds each node as a separate job. Depending on your setup, you might prefer to add all nodes to a single job, which would require a slightly different approach. If you need that instead, let me know and I can provide an alternative configuration.

Thanks, that worked. If I have a running instance of Prometheus Server, is there a way to "register" this node_exporter with the server using ansible

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The error you're seeing is due to the incorrect placement of the include_role task. In Ansible, include_role is a task-level directive, not a play-level one. Let's correct the playbook structure. Here's the revised version of your mount-disks.yml playbook:

---
- name: Mount formatted disks using ansible-role-disk
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Display formatted_disks variable
      debug:
        var: formatted_disks

    - name: Display mount variable

    - name: Display node_exporter status
      debug:
        msg: "node_exporter is {{ 'accessible' if node_exporter_check.status == 200 else 'not accessible' }}"

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
Key changes:

The include_role task is now correctly placed under the tasks section of the second play.

The structure now has two distinct plays: one for mounting disks and another for installing and configuring node_exporter.

This structure should resolve the error you encountered. The include_role is now correctly used as a task within the play, rather than as a play-level directive.

To use this updated playbook:

Ensure you have the prometheus.prometheus collection installed:

ansible-galaxy collection install prometheus.prometheus

Copy

text
Save the updated playbook as mount-disks.yml.

Run the playbook:

This playbook will first mount your disks using the kevincoakley.disk role, and then install and configure node_exporter using the prometheus.prometheus.node_exporter role. If you encounter any further issues, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot.

ERROR! 'include_role' is not a valid attribute for a Play

The error appears to be in '/mnt/c/Users/kmpet/dev/IaC/ansible/playbooks/mount-disks.yml': line 38, column 3, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

name: Install node_exporter

I apologize for the confusion. It seems the error message was cut off in your response. Without seeing the full error message, it's difficult to diagnose the exact problem. However, I can provide some general troubleshooting steps and common issues that might occur when using the prometheus.prometheus collection to install node_exporter.

Collection not found: If you get an error saying the collection or role is not found, ensure you've installed the prometheus.prometheus collection:

ansible-galaxy collection install prometheus.prometheus

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
Role not found within the collection: If the role isn't found within the collection, double-check the role name. It should be prometheus.prometheus.node_exporter.

Version compatibility issues: Ensure that the version of node_exporter you're trying to install is compatible with the role. You might need to check the role's documentation for supported versions.

Permission issues: Make sure your Ansible user has sufficient permissions to install packages and create services on the target system.

Network issues: If the role is trying to download node_exporter and failing, it could be due to network issues or proxy settings.

SELinux or AppArmor: If you're using SELinux or AppArmor, they might be preventing the installation or execution of node_exporter.

To help diagnose the issue, you could try adding more verbose output to your Ansible run:

ansible-playbook -i your_inventory mount_disks_and_node_exporter.yml -vvv

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
This will provide more detailed output, which could help identify where exactly the playbook is failing.

If you can provide the full error message, I'd be happy to offer more specific advice on how to resolve the issue.

I get the following error

Certainly! I'd be happy to help you update the playbook to install node_exporter using the prometheus.prometheus collection. First, make sure you have the collection installed. You can do this by adding it to your requirements.yml file or by running: [1]

ansible-galaxy collection install prometheus.prometheus

Now, let's update the playbook to include the installation of node_exporter. We'll add this as a new play in the existing playbook. Here's how you can modify your mount_disks.yml playbook:

---

This updated playbook does the following:

It keeps the existing play for mounting disks using the kevincoakley.disk role.

It adds a new play specifically for installing and configuring node_exporter.

In the new play:

We define variables for the node_exporter version and the address it should listen on.

We use the prometheus.prometheus.node_exporter role to install node_exporter.

We ensure that the node_exporter service is started and enabled.

We perform a check to see if node_exporter is accessible on the expected port.

Finally, we display the status of node_exporter.

To use this updated playbook:

Ensure you have the prometheus.prometheus collection installed.

Save the updated playbook as mount_disks_and_node_exporter.yml (or keep the existing name if you prefer).

Run the playbook:

ansible-playbook -i your_inventory mount_disks_and_node_exporter.yml

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
This playbook will mount your disks as before and then install and configure node_exporter using the prometheus.prometheus collection.

Note: The node_exporter role from the prometheus.prometheus collection might have additional variables you can configure. You can check the role's documentation for more customization options if needed.

The error you're encountering suggests there might be an issue with SSL certificate handling when the role is trying to download the mergerfs package. This could be due to an outdated version of the urllib3 library or a problem with the Python SSL configuration on your system.

Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

Update the urllib3 library on your control node (the machine from which you're running Ansible):

pip install --upgrade urllib3

Copy

Insert at cursor

If that doesn't work, you can try to modify the role to use the get_url module instead of the apt module for downloading the package. Here's how you can do this:Create a file named tigattack.mergerfs.yml in your ansible/roles directory with the following content:

---<p></p>

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
Then, in your playbook, include this role after the tigattack.mergerfs role:
roles:

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
If the issue persists, you might need to temporarily disable SSL verification. This is not recommended for production environments, but can help diagnose the problem:

- name: Download mergerfs package
  get_url:
    url: "<a href="https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs/releases/download/%7B%7B">https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs/releases/download/{{</a> mergerfs_version }}/mergerfs_{{ mergerfs_version }}.ubuntu-{{ ansible_distribution_release }}<em>amd64.deb"

    mode: '0644'
    validate_certs: no
  register: download_deb

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
Another option is to manually download the .deb file and use the copy module to transfer it to the target machine, then install it using the apt module.

Lastly, ensure that your target system (where mergerfs is being installed) has the necessary CA certificates installed:

- name: Ensure ca-certificates is installed
  apt:
    name: ca-certificates
    state: present
    update_cache: yes

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
Include this task before attempting to install mergerfs.
If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your Ansible control node's operating system and Python version, as well as the target system's details. This will help in further troubleshooting the issue.

I added the role tigattack.mergerfs and get the following error, any ideas? TASK [tigattack.mergerfs : Install mergerfs package with apt] **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. You're right that there was an issue with the variable name and structure. Let's correct this and adjust the playbook to work correctly with the kevincoakley.disk role.

Based on the error message and the role's documentation, we need to adjust our host_vars file and playbook. Here's the corrected version:

First, update your host_vars file ( host_vars/your_hostname.yml):

---
formatted_disks:
  - uuid1
  - uuid2
  - uuid3

mount:
  - path: "/mnt/disk1"
    src: "/dev/disk/by-uuid/{{ formatted_disks[0] }}"
    fstype: ext4
    opts: "defaults"
    state: "mounted"
  - path: "/mnt/disk2"
    src: "/dev/disk/by-uuid/{{ formatted_disks[1] }}"
    fstype: ext4
    opts: "defaults"
    state: "mounted"
  - path: "/mnt/disk3"
    src: "/dev/disk/by-uuid/{{ formatted_disks[2] }}"
    fstype: ext4
    opts: "defaults"
    state: "mounted"

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
Now, let's update the playbook ( mount_disks.yml):

---
- name: Mount formatted disks using ansible-role-disk
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Display formatted_disks variable
      debug:
        var: formatted_disks

    - name: Display mount variable
      debug:
        var: mount

  roles:
    - role: kevincoakley.disk
      disk_additional_packages:
        - xfsprogs

  post_tasks:
    - name: Display mounted disks
      command: df -h
      changed_when: false
      register: df_output

    - name: Show mounted disks
      debug:
        var: df_output.stdout_lines

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
Key changes:

In the host_vars file, we've renamed disk_mounts to mount to match the role's expected variable name.

Each item in the mount list now includes a path key instead of mount_point, and we've added a state key set to "mounted".

In the playbook, we've removed the disk_mounts variable from the role parameters, as it will automatically use the mount variable from the host_vars file.

These changes should resolve the error you encountered. The role will now correctly recognize the mount variable and use it to mount the disks.

To use this setup:

Ensure you have the kevincoakley.disk role installed.

Update your host_vars file ( host_vars/your_hostname.yml) with the correct UUIDs and desired mount points.

Save the updated playbook as mount_disks.yml.

Run the playbook:

ansible-playbook -i your_inventory mount_disks.yml

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
This should now correctly mount your disks using the ansible-role-disk. The debug tasks in the playbook will help you verify that the variables are correctly loaded from the host_vars file before the mounting operation begins.

something is working withthe mount_disks.yml. As you provided, the Control active and configured mount points step is skipped. I believe because the variable called disk_mounts under the role is not correct. I renamed it to mount, as per documentation, and get the following error fatal: [test-nas.flopo.retropetro.net]: FAILED! => {"msg": "The task includes an option with an undefined variable. The error was: 'dict object' has no attribute 'path'\n\nThe error appears to be in '/home/pofo14/.ansible/roles/kevincoakley.disk/tasks/mount.yml': line 2, column 3, but may\nbe elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.\n\nThe offending line appears to be:\n\n---\n- name: Control active and configured mount points\n ^ here\n"}

Great question! The xfsprogs package is included in the disk_additional_packages variable for the ansible-role-disk, and it's related to the XFS filesystem. Let me explain its purpose:

xfsprogs is a set of command line utilities for managing and maintaining XFS filesystems. XFS is a high-performance journaling file system originally created by Silicon Graphics, Inc. It's now widely used in many Linux distributions.

The xfsprogs package includes several important tools:

mkfs.xfs: For creating new XFS filesystems

xfs_repair: For repairing corrupt or damaged XFS filesystems

xfs_fsr: For filesystem defragmentation

xfs_db: A debugging tool for XFS filesystems

xfs_quota: For managing quotas on XFS filesystems

And several other utilities for various XFS-related tasks

In the context of the ansible-role-disk, including xfsprogs ensures that these tools are available on the system. This is particularly useful if:

You're creating or managing XFS filesystems (even though in our example we're using ext4).

The role needs to perform any XFS-related operations.

You want the flexibility to switch to XFS filesystems in the future without modifying the playbook.

However, in our specific case where we're using ext4 filesystems, the xfsprogs package isn't strictly necessary. If you're certain you won't be using XFS filesystems, you could remove it from the disk_additional_packages list.

If you want to ensure you have the necessary tools for ext4 filesystems, you might consider adding e2fsprogs instead, which provides utilities for ext2, ext3, and ext4 filesystems. But in most cases, e2fsprogs is already installed by default on most Linux distributions.

To summarize, including xfsprogs in the role provides flexibility for managing XFS filesystems, but it's not required for the ext4 filesystems we're using in our current setup.

thanks, out of curiousity, what does the xfsprogs do

Absolutely! We can simplify this by moving more of the configuration into the host_vars file. This approach will make the playbook cleaner and more reusable. Let's revise both the host_vars file and the playbook.

First, let's update the host_vars file ( host_vars/your_hostname.yml):

---
formatted_disks:
  - uuid1
  - uuid2
  - uuid3

disk_mounts:
  - mount_point: "/mnt/disk1"
    src: "/dev/disk/by-uuid/{{ formatted_disks[0] }}"
    fstype: ext4
    opts: defaults
  - mount_point: "/mnt/disk2"
    src: "/dev/disk/by-uuid/{{ formatted_disks[1] }}"
    fstype: ext4
    opts: defaults
  - mount_point: "/mnt/disk3"
    src: "/dev/disk/by-uuid/{{ formatted_disks[2] }}"
    fstype: ext4
    opts: defaults

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
Now, let's simplify the playbook ( mount_disks.yml):

---
- name: Mount formatted disks using ansible-role-disk
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Display formatted_disks variable
      debug:
        var: formatted_disks

    - name: Display disk_mounts variable
      debug:
        var: disk_mounts

  roles:
    - role: kevincoakley.disk
      disk_additional_packages:
        - xfsprogs
      disk_mounts: "{{ disk_mounts }}"

  post_tasks:
    - name: Display mounted disks
      command: df -h
      changed_when: false
      register: df_output

    - name: Show mounted disks
      debug:
        var: df_output.stdout_lines

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
This simplified approach offers several benefits:

The formatted_disks and disk_mounts variables are defined in the host_vars file, making it easy to customize per host.

The disk_mounts variable in the host_vars file directly maps to the structure expected by the ansible-role-disk, eliminating the need for complex transformations in the playbook.

The playbook becomes much simpler and more focused on the task of mounting the disks.

You can easily add or remove disks by updating the host_vars file without changing the playbook.

To use this setup:

Ensure you have the kevincoakley.disk role installed.

Update your host_vars file ( host_vars/your_hostname.yml) with the correct UUIDs and desired mount points.

Save the playbook as mount_disks.yml.

Run the playbook:

ansible-playbook -i your_inventory mount_disks.yml

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
This approach gives you the flexibility to define different disk configurations for different hosts while keeping the playbook itself simple and reusable. The debug tasks in the playbook will help you verify that the variables are correctly loaded from the host_vars file before the mounting operation begins.

can I simplify this. Can we assume the formatted_disk variable is defined in a host _vars file. Can I then also define the mount variables in there to loop through this formatted_disk array, and specify the src attribute to this role as /dev/disk/by-uuid/{{item}}

Certainly! I'll rewrite the playbook to use the ansible-role-disk, focusing on the mount functionality. First, you'll need to install this role. You can do this by adding it to your requirements.yml file or installing it directly using:

ansible-galaxy install kevincoakley.disk

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
Now, let's create a playbook that uses this role to mount the disks:

---
- name: Mount formatted disks using ansible-role-disk
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  vars:
    mount_point_prefix: "/mnt/disk"

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Include host vars
      include_vars:
        file: "{{ playbook_dir }}/../host_vars/{{ inventory_hostname }}"

    - name: Display formatted_disks variable
      debug:
        var: formatted_disks

    - name: Prepare disk_mounts variable
      set_fact:
        disk_mounts: "{{ formatted_disks | map('zip', range(1, formatted_disks|length + 1)) | map('list') | list }}"

    - name: Display disk_mounts variable
      debug:
        var: disk_mounts

  roles:
    - role: kevincoakley.disk
      disk_additional_packages:
        - xfsprogs
      disk_mounts: "{{ disk_mounts | map('dict', ['uuid', 'id']) | list | 
                       map('combine', {'fstype': 'ext4', 'mount_point': mount_point_prefix, 'mount_options': 'defaults'}) | list }}"

  post_tasks:
    - name: Display mounted disks
      command: df -h
      changed_when: false
      register: df_output

    - name: Show mounted disks
      debug:
        var: df_output.stdout_lines

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
This playbook does the following:

It includes the host vars file to get the formatted_disks variable.

It displays the formatted_disks variable for verification.

It prepares a disk_mounts variable that pairs each UUID with a number, which we'll use for the mount point.

It uses the kevincoakley.disk role to mount the disks. The disk_mounts variable is formatted to match the expected structure for the role:

uuid: The UUID of the disk

id: A unique identifier (we use it for numbering)

fstype: Set to 'ext4'

mount_point: The base mount point (we'll append the ID to this)

mount_options: Set to 'defaults'

After mounting, it displays the mounted disks using df -h for verification.

To use this playbook:

Ensure you have installed the kevincoakley.disk role.

Save the playbook as mount_disks.yml (or any name you prefer).

Run it with:

ansible-playbook -i your_inventory mount_disks.yml

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
This playbook leverages the ansible-role-disk to handle the mounting of the disks. It uses the UUIDs from your formatted_disks variable to ensure each disk is mounted consistently.

Note that this role also handles creating the mount points and updating /etc/fstab for persistent mounts, so you don't need to add separate tasks for these operations.

If you need to customize any other aspects of the disk mounting process, you can refer to the ansible-role-disk documentation for additional variables and options you can set.

could you re-write this using the ansible-role-disk role found at https://github.com/kevincoakley/ansible-role-disk, specifically using the mount play within that role

Absolutely! We can create an Ansible playbook that uses the formatted_disks variable to mount each partition using its UUID in corresponding /mnt/disk<number> folders. This approach ensures that each drive is consistently mounted to the same location across reboots or system changes. Here's a playbook that accomplishes this:

---
- name: Mount formatted disks
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    mount_point_prefix: "/mnt/disk"

  tasks:
    - name: Include host vars
      include_vars:
        file: "{{ playbook_dir }}/../host_vars/{{ inventory_hostname }}"

    - name: Display formatted_disks variable
      debug:
        var: formatted_disks

    - name: Ensure mount point directories exist
      file:
        path: "{{ mount_point_prefix }}{{ index }}"
        state: directory
        mode: '0755'
      loop: "{{ formatted_disks }}"
      loop_control:
        index_var: index

    - name: Mount disks by UUID
      mount:
        path: "{{ mount_point_prefix }}{{ index }}"
        src: "UUID={{ item }}"
        fstype: ext4
        state: mounted
        opts: defaults
      loop: "{{ formatted_disks }}"
      loop_control:
        index_var: index

    - name: Display mounted disks
      command: df -h
      changed_when: false
      register: df_output

    - name: Show mounted disks
      debug:
        var: df_output.stdout_lines

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
This playbook does the following:

It includes the host vars file, which contains the formatted_disks variable we created in the previous playbook.

It displays the formatted_disks variable for verification.

It creates the necessary mount point directories ( /mnt/disk1, /mnt/disk2, etc.) based on the number of UUIDs in formatted_disks.

It uses the mount module to mount each disk by its UUID to the corresponding mount point. The loop and loop_control ensure that each disk gets a unique number.

Finally, it displays the mounted disks using the df -h command for verification.

To use this playbook:

Save it as mount_disks.yml (or any name you prefer).

Run it with:

ansible-playbook -i your_inventory mount_disks.yml

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
This playbook ensures that:

Each disk is mounted using its UUID, which is more reliable than device names.

The mount points are created if they don't exist.

Each disk is consistently mounted to the same numbered folder ( /mnt/disk1, /mnt/disk2, etc.) based on its order in the formatted_disks list.

If you want to make these mounts persistent across reboots, you can add an additional task to update /etc/fstab:

    - name: Update /etc/fstab for persistent mounts
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/fstab
        line: "UUID={{ item }} {{ mount_point_prefix }}{{ index }} ext4 defaults 0 2"
        regexp: "^UUID={{ item }}"
      loop: "{{ formatted_disks }}"
      loop_control:
        index_var: index

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
Add this task at the end of the playbook to ensure the mounts persist after system reboots.

I would like to now use the variable that was created before, formatted_disks, and using the mount module loop through that variable and mount each partition in a corresponding /mnt/disk<number> folder. Can I use the UUID in this command to ensure each drive is mounted in the same disk<number> folder each time

Certainly! I'm glad the previous script has been tested and verified. I'm ready to help you create another Ansible playbook. What would you like this new playbook to do? Please provide some details about the tasks you want to accomplish, and I'll be happy to assist you in creating a new Ansible play. [1]

Thanks - the previous script has been tested and verified. Now I would like to code another anbile play with you

I apologize for the oversight. You're absolutely right, and I appreciate you pointing that out. Let's modify this section to ensure proper YAML formatting. Here's an improved version of that task: [1]

- name: Update host_vars file
  copy:
    content: |
      formatted_disks:
        {{ combined_formatted_disks | to_nice_yaml(indent=2) | indent(2) }}
    dest: "{{ playbook_dir }}/../host_vars/{{ inventory_hostname }}"

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
This modification does the following:

We've moved formatted_disks: to its own line.

The content of combined_formatted_disks will start on the next line, properly indented.

We're still using to_nice_yaml to format the list of UUIDs, and indent(2) to ensure proper indentation within the YAML structure.

Now, the resulting YAML in the host_vars file should look like this:

formatted_disks:
  - uuid1
  - uuid2
  - uuid3

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
This format ensures that formatted_disks is correctly defined as a YAML list, with each UUID on its own line and properly indented.

If you want to be extra cautious about preserving other variables that might exist in the host_vars file, you could consider using a YAML-aware approach. Here's an alternative that uses the combine filter and to_yaml:

- name: Read existing host_vars file
  slurp:
    src: "{{ playbook_dir }}/../host_vars/{{ inventory_hostname }}"
  register: existing_host_vars
  ignore_errors: yes

- name: Parse existing host_vars
  set_fact:
    existing_vars: "{{ (existing_host_vars.content | b64decode | from_yaml) if existing_host_vars is succeeded else {} }}"

- name: Update host_vars file
  copy:
    content: "{{ existing_vars | combine({'formatted_disks': combined_formatted_disks}) | to_nice_yaml }}"
    dest: "{{ playbook_dir }}/../host_vars/{{ inventory_hostname }}"

Copy

Insert at cursor
yaml
This approach will:

Read the existing host_vars file (if it exists).

Parse the existing variables.

Combine the existing variables with the updated formatted_disks.

Write the entire updated YAML structure back to the file.

This method ensures that other variables in the host_vars file are preserved while updating formatted_disks.

Key changes in this updated playbook:

We now read the existing host_vars file using the slurp module, which allows us to safely read the file even if it doesn't exist yet.

We parse the existing formatted_disks variable from the host_vars file, defaulting to an empty list if it doesn't exist.

We combine the existing formatted_disks with the newly formatted disks, using the unique filter to remove any duplicates.

Instead of using lineinfile, we now use the copy module to write the entire formatted_disks variable. This ensures proper YAML formatting and avoids issues with multi-line strings.

We use to_nice_yaml and indent filters to format the YAML output nicely in the host_vars file.

This playbook will now append new disk UUIDs to the existing formatted_disks variable, ensuring that:

Previously formatted disks are not lost

Newly formatted disks are added to the list

Duplicate entries are removed

The playbook also retains all the debug statements to help you verify the process at each step. You can run this playbook multiple times, and it will continue to append new disk UUIDs without overwriting the existing ones.

thanks. Can the playbook be modified to ensure that the formatted_disks variable is appended to and not overwritten on subsequent runs

I apologize for the inconvenience. The task hanging at that step suggests there might be an issue with permissions or the delegation to localhost. Let's modify the playbook to work around this issue and provide more information for debugging. Here's an updated version: [1]

The lineinfile task now uses to_yaml filter to ensure proper YAML formatting when writing to the host_vars file.

We've kept all the debug statements to help identify where any issues might occur.

This playbook does the following:

Creates a GPT partition on each disk specified in new_disk_ids.

Creates an ext4 filesystem on each partitioned disk.

Retrieves the UUID for each formatted partition.

Ensures the host_vars directory exists.

Updates the host_vars file for the current host with an array of formatted disk UUIDs.

Checks if the host_vars file exists and displays its content.

Includes several debug statements to show:

The UUID of each formatted disk

Whether the host_vars file exists

The content of the host_vars file (if it exists)

The final list of formatted disk UUIDs

To use this playbook:

Ensure you have the community.general collection installed:

ansible-galaxy collection install community.general

Define the new_disk_ids variable in your inventory or as an extra var when running the playbook. For example:

ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml -e '{"new_disk_ids": ["scsi-1ATA_VBOX_HARDDISK_VB1234", "scsi-1ATA_VBOX_HARDDISK_VB5678"]}'

Copy

This playbook assumes that the host_vars directory is one level up from the playbook directory. Adjust the path if your directory structure is different.

The playbook will create or update a formatted_disks variable in the host_vars file, containing an array of UUIDs for the newly formatted disks. It also includes extensive debugging to help you verify each step of the process.

lets start completely over. Please create me a ansible playbook, that reads a variable calls new_disk_ids, which contains the id of unformatted disks on a linux system. Using the parted module, create a partition, and then create an ext4 filesystem that uses the entire size of the disk. Then I would like the playbook to output the UUID of the formatted disk(s) into an array/variable in the host_vars file for this host. Also please included debugging statements that print out the value of the UUIDs, and if the host_vars file is found and exists.

I apologize for the confusion. Let's troubleshoot this issue step by step. If the playbook is running without errors but the host_vars file is not being created or updated, there could be a few reasons for this. Let's review and modify the playbook to ensure it works as expected.

First, let's look at a modified version of the playbook that includes more verbose logging and error checking:

- name: Format disk and update host_vars
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    disk_device: /dev/sdb
    mount_point: /data
  
  tasks:
    - name: Format the disk
      filesystem:
        fstype: ext4
        dev: "{{ disk_device }}"
      register: format_result

    - name: Get disk UUID
      command: blkid -s UUID -o value {{ disk_device }}
      register: disk_uuid
      changed_when: false

    - name: Debug disk UUID
      debug:
        var: disk_uuid.stdout

    - name: Ensure host_vars directory exists
      file:
        path: "{{ playbook_dir }}/../host_vars"
        state: directory
      delegate_to: localhost
      run_once: true

    - name: Update host_vars file
      lineinfile:
        path: "{{ playbook_dir }}/../host_vars/{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        line: "disk_uuid: {{ disk_uuid.stdout }}"
        create: yes
      delegate_to: localhost

    - name: Debug host_vars file content
      command: cat "{{ playbook_dir }}/../host_vars/{{ inventory_hostname }}"
      register: host_vars_content
      delegate_to: localhost
      changed_when: false

    - name: Display host_vars file content
      debug:
        var: host_vars_content.stdout_lines

Copy

yaml
This modified playbook includes several improvements:

We've added a task to ensure the host_vars directory exists.

We're using the lineinfile module instead of copy to update the host_vars file. This allows us to add or update a single line without overwriting the entire file.

We've added debug tasks to display the disk UUID and the content of the host_vars file after the update.

Here are some additional troubleshooting steps:

Verify paths: Double-check that {{ playbook_dir }}/../host_vars/ is the correct path relative to your playbook location.

Check permissions: Ensure that the user running the playbook has write permissions for the host_vars directory and files.

Run with increased verbosity: Use the -vvv flag when running your playbook to get more detailed output:

ansible-playbook -vvv your_playbook.yml

Check for SELinux: If you're running on a system with SELinux enabled, it might be preventing file creation. You can temporarily disable SELinux to test:

sudo setenforce 0

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
Remember to re-enable it after testing:
sudo setenforce 1

Verify inventory: Make sure your inventory file correctly defines inventory_hostname for each host.

Run with --check mode: This will do a dry run and might provide more information:

ansible-playbook --check your_playbook.yml

Copy

If you're still encountering issues after trying these steps, please provide the output of running the playbook with increased verbosity ( -vvv). This will help identify where exactly the process is failing or not behaving as expected.

you gave me an ansible play before that would update my host_vars file with the uuid of the disk that just got formatted, but it is still not working. There is no error, and the paths are correct, but the file is never getting created
