Starlord - COmpleted, fix node_exporter error by switching to geerlingguy.node_exporter

Working on test-server (thanos) now.  
- DOcker Compose File is work, like it.  Keep this approach
 - mergerfs mount is having an error - need to troubleshoot that
  - has trouble doing mounting.  Think I want to switch to use grog.package role to install mergerfs
  - then create a host role like the ktz.morpheus role for folders, disks, mounts, etc  This uses the standard mount module for mergerfs

Long term:
 - will need to test (yuk) - see hw we can automate
 - need to setup healthcheck urls, but want to get that running locally first (galactus)

 TODO: 
 Look at Ironic Badgers Morpheus role, these are host specific roles.  That have special disk configurations.
  This seems to be how he handles more "one time" config stuff

ansible-playbook site.yaml -v -i staging --limit thanos --ask-become-pass 

export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=./ansible.cfg
